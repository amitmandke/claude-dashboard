# Claude Dashboard — Component Design

A local dashboard to observe and interact with every Claude Code session running on this
machine. One Node.js process (zero npm dependencies) serves a browser UI; nothing leaves
localhost.

```

**Key insight that shapes the design:** Claude Code already maintains a live registry at
`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` with `status: idle | busy | waiting` and even
`waitingFor: "permission prompt"`. The dashboard never guesses session state — it reads
the same source of truth Claude Code writes. Transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/`
provide the starting prompt, every action taken, and live token usage.

**Terminal backends:** interaction is routed through pluggable backends
(`services/terminals/`). Each claude process's environment (read once via `ps -E`)
says which terminal hosts it — `TMUX` → tmux, `TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app` → iTerm2,
`TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal` → Terminal.app; anything else renders as an observe-only
card. All backends implement the same six operations (sendText, sendKey, focus,
closePane, readScreen, sessionTitle) plus spawnSession. New-session launches pick
iTerm2 → Terminal.app → tmux, first available (`CLAUDE_DASH_SPAWN=iterm|terminal|tmux`
overrides). When nothing is running, the iTerm2 backend launches the app itself
(`open -b com.googlecode.iterm2`) and polls until it answers AppleScript before
creating the window — creating a window mid-launch fails with opaque AppleEvent errors.

| Backend | Mechanism | Caveats |
|---|---|---|
| iTerm2 | AppleScript (`write text`, `text of session`) | one-time "control iTerm2" permission |
| Terminal.app | AppleScript `do script` + System Events keystrokes | Esc/raw keys need Accessibility permission and focus the window; window-level titles only |
| tmux | tmux CLI (`send-keys`, `capture-pane`) — works on Linux and under any host terminal | `focus` selects the pane but can't raise the host window |

## 2. Processes / apps

| App | Folder | Tech | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| dashboard-server | `server/` | Node.js ≥18, no deps | Scans registry + transcripts, pushes live state over SSE, drives iTerm2 (send input, focus panes, launch new sessions) |
| dashboard-web | `web/` | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step | Two in-page tabs (Sessions / Candidates): summary bar with filters, session cards, flashing alerts, quick actions, composer, New Session dialog; the Candidates tab lists launchable pending work with a text filter |

A single `node server/src/index.js` runs everything; the web app is static files served
by the same process. `scripts/install-launchd.sh` installs it as a macOS launchd user
agent (starts at login, restarts on crash, logs to `~/Library/Logs/claude-dashboard.log`).
The log records every interaction (`ACTION send|key|focus|end|spawn|ai-title …`) and every
failed request (`ERROR <method> <path>: <message>`), so misbehavior is diagnosable after
the fact.

## 3. UI design

### Session card anatomy (one per live session)

| Zone | Content | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Header | status dot + **session title** + rename (✎) + status badge | title precedence: ✎ custom title (persisted in `~/.claude-dashboard/titles.json` by sessionId; empty reverts) → AI-derived title (see below) → the terminal title Claude Code sets → the first prompt → folder name |
| Meta row | project · full cwd, pid, model, uptime, `ctx <n> · ↑<n>` live tokens | monospace, subdued |
| "Started with" | first real user prompt of the session | clamped to 3 lines; click to expand |
| Activity feed | last 40 actions: tool calls (`⚙ Bash — run pytest`), your prompts — including skill/slash-command invocations, rendered as `/review-pr 1234` — Claude's replies, tool errors (`✗`) | auto-scrolls to newest unless you scrolled up; **Claude entries are clickable** — marked with a ⤢ arrow and a hover highlight (echoing the Open-in-iTerm ↗ convention) — feed text is truncated to 200 chars, clicking fetches the complete message on demand (`/text?at=`) and renders it as styled markdown in a scrollable popup (`md.js`, a zero-dep renderer with regex-based syntax tinting for code fences; input HTML-escaped; popup theme replicates the "Markdown Reader" Chrome extension's dark theme — Atom One Dark palette, blue `#6785e0` primary) |
| Live progress line | the spinner line Claude Code renders in the pane while working — `✽ Germinating… (1m 57s · ↓ 6.7k tokens)` — so a `busy` card shows the same motion you'd see in the terminal | polled from the pane (`/screen`) every ~2s while `busy`, matched by glyph + gerund + `(stats)` shape (not by "esc to interrupt", which the shortcut-hint bar also contains); breathing teal; hidden for other statuses |
| Question banner | one compact line (full text on hover): for `waiting` — the pending tool call with the **literal command** (`wants to run Bash — cd /repo && git log…`) or AskUserQuestion text, in red; for `reply` — Claude's closing question, in amber | hidden for `done`/`busy`; pending tool = most recent tool call with no result in the transcript; clicking the amber banner opens the full-reply markdown popup |
| Terminal mirror | the bottom ~40 lines of the session's actual pane while `waiting` — the permission dialog exactly as rendered, including the command and Claude Code's safety warning ("this command changes directory before running git…"), which exist only on screen, not in any file | fetched from iTerm2 (`text of session`) once per waiting episode; hidden otherwise |
| Quick actions | Approve / Always / Deny / Deny-&-redirect | only visible while the card is `waiting` |
| Composer | text input + ⏎ toggle + Send + ⎋ Esc + Open in iTerm ↗ | see interactions below; ⎋ Esc sends a bare Esc — interrupts the running turn or dismisses a menu (always available, unlike Deny which only shows while `waiting`); lights up red while the session is `busy` (there's a turn to interrupt), dull gray otherwise |
| Expand (⛶ in header) | lift the card into a large centered overlay (≈960px × 88vh, drag the bottom-right corner to resize up to 96vw × 92vh) over a dimmed backdrop | same DOM node, so the live feed/composer/quick-actions keep working while expanded; collapse via ⛶ / Esc / backdrop click drops it back into its exact grid spot at the default size (the drag-resize inline width/height are cleared on collapse); one card expanded at a time |
| End (✕ in header) | interrupt (Esc) → `/exit` → wait for process exit → close the iTerm pane | ending kills the session's context, so confirmation is status-aware: `done` closes silently (nothing to lose); `busy`/`waiting`/`reply` confirm with a message naming what would be lost (in-progress turn, pending approval, unanswered question); refuses (409) if the session won't exit |

Every action button follows the same lifecycle: pressed-down scale on click, dimmed +
disabled while the request is in flight, a brief green "✓ done" state on success, then
back to normal; failures restore the button and show an error toast. Quick actions exist
in the DOM only while their card is `waiting`.

### Status → visual language

The registry reports `busy | idle | waiting`. The server refines `idle` into two derived
states using two transcript signals (heuristics — see trade-offs):

1. **Question at the end** — the last message asks the user something (`?`, "let me
   know", "should I…").
2. **Undelivered deliverable** — the last message is a structured document (markdown
   headers, e.g. a drafted review) **and** the final turn ran no side-effecting action
   (no `git push`/`git commit`, `gh pr review|comment|merge`, mutating `gh api`/`curl`,
   mutating MCP calls, or file writes). The work product exists only in the chat, so the
   user still has to do something with it. A review *posted to GitHub* in that turn
   counts as delivered → `done`; the same review only printed in chat → `reply`.

| Derived status | Meaning | Visual |
|---|---|---|
| `busy` | Claude is working | green dot, gentle breathing, calm card |
| `reply` | Claude finished **but the user still has to act** — a question is pending or a deliverable hasn't left the chat | amber dot, soft border pulse, amber banner showing the closing text |
| `done` | turn fully complete — nothing pending, ready for a new prompt | gray dot, calm card, no animation |
| `waiting` (+ `waitingFor`) | hard-blocked on you — e.g. permission prompt | **red flashing border + background strobe**, badge shows the reason, red banner shows the exact pending tool call/question |
| process gone | session exited | card disappears |

Cards auto-sort: `waiting`, then `reply`, then `done`, then `busy` — oldest session first
within a status. The grid re-orders live as statuses change, except while the cursor is
inside a card (moving a DOM node would drop focus mid-typing); it catches up on the next
tick after focus leaves. The browser tab title also flashes
(`🔴 1 waiting — Claude Dashboard`) so you see it from any other tab.

### Summary bar (top of page)

Clickable stat tiles, doubling as filters for the grid (click again to clear). The
"Need attention" tile flashes red (same animation as `waiting` cards) whenever its
count is above zero:

```
┌──────────┬─────────┬────────────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────────┐
│ 4        │ 1       │ 1              │ 1                    │ 1             │
│ Total    │ Working │ Need attention │ Awaiting your action │ Turn complete │
└──────────┴─────────┴────────────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────────┘
```

### Quick actions (shown only on a `waiting` card)

```
[✓ Approve]  [✓✓ Always]  [✗ Deny]  [✎ Deny & redirect]
     │            │           │              │
  sends the   sends the     sends Esc    sends Esc, focuses the composer
  "Yes" digit "don't-ask"                 so you type what to do instead
  (usually 1) digit
```

The digit each button sends is **parsed from the live dialog** (mirrored on screen),
not assumed — see `web/public/dialog.js`. Claude Code drops the "don't ask again" line
for commands it can't form a reusable allow-rule for (e.g. a compound `cd X && git …`),
leaving a **two-option** menu where option 2 is *"No … (esc)"*. Blindly sending `2`
there would deny the tool, so **Always is shown only when the prompt actually offers a
don't-ask-again option**; on a two-option dialog it is hidden. Approve maps to the "Yes"
digit (option 1), Deny always sends Esc.

### Candidates view (second tab)

A **candidate session** is a session you *could* launch but haven't yet — a concrete plan
(`cwd` + optional skill + prompt) waiting in a list with a **reason** and a **priority**.
It decouples *"something proposes work"* from *"a session actually runs"*: nothing spawns
until you choose it. Candidates have several **producers** — a running Claude session that
discovers follow-up work and calls `POST /api/candidates`, the **Add to candidates** button
on the launch page, and the **New candidate** form in the UI (watchers are a later
producer; see §7). All converge on one list.

The dashboard is still **one page and one SSE stream**: a header **tab toggle** flips
between the Sessions view (everything above) and the Candidates view. The Candidates tab
carries a **count badge** of pending items, visible from either tab so you notice new work
without switching.

```

Each card shows the **skill**, the **prompt**, the **reason**, the directory, and the
**source/producer** (+ a provenance link when present). The **filter** box narrows the
visible cards by case-insensitive substring across skill / prompt / reason / cwd / source —
purely client-side, since the full list is already in the snapshot. Per-card actions:

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| **▷ Launch** | spawn it via the same path as New Session; the candidate is marked `launched` and a normal live card appears on the Sessions tab. Disabled (with an "N running" hint) when the live-session count is at `maxConcurrent`. |
| **▲ / ▼** | raise / lower priority; the list re-sorts (higher launches first, oldest-first within a priority) |
| **⌥ Skill** / click the prompt | edit the plan before launching (skill / prompt) |
| **✕ Dismiss** / **↩ Restore** | drop a pending item / restore a dismissed one |
| **✕ Clear** | remove a `launched`/`dismissed` item from the list immediately |

`launched` and `dismissed` items stay in the list (greyed, still filterable) as a short
history of what was proposed and what you did with it. They auto-prune on a retention sweep —
`launched` quickly (hours, since it's already a live session), `dismissed` after a few days —
or you can **✕ Clear** one right away.

## 4. User interactions

1. **Glance** — open `http://localhost:7777`; every live session appears as a card within ~1.5s, updating live over SSE (no refresh ever needed). Connection health is silent when good — a red "reconnecting…" appears in the header only while the stream is down.
2. **Spot trouble** — a session that needs you flashes red (permission prompt) or pulses amber (turn finished, waiting for your next prompt). Tab title flashes too.
3. **Read the story** — each card shows where the session runs (cwd), what prompt started it, and a scrolling feed of every action: tools used, files touched, commands run, errors hit, what Claude last said.
   **Read a full reply** — click any Claude entry in the feed (or the amber reply banner) to open the complete message, rendered as markdown in a scrollable popup (close: ✕, Esc, or click outside).
4. **Reply without switching windows** — type in the composer, hit Send → the text is typed into that session's iTerm2 pane and submitted.
5. **Answer menus/permission prompts** — untick the ⏎ toggle to send raw characters without Enter (e.g. `1` to choose an option).
6. **Jump to the terminal** — "Open in iTerm ↗" raises that exact iTerm2 tab/pane for full manual control.
7. **Interrupt a running turn** — ⎋ Esc in the composer row sends a bare Esc to the pane, exactly like pressing Esc in the terminal (stops the current turn; the session stays alive and waits for new instructions).
8. **One-click permission handling** — flashing cards show Approve / Always / Deny / Deny-&-redirect buttons that inject the matching keystrokes.
9. **Start a new session from the UI** — ＋ New Session opens a dialog with a recent-projects picker (from `~/.claude/history.jsonl`), an optional **skill picker** (user + project skills/commands, like typing `/` in Claude; the prompt field becomes the skill's arguments), and an optional initial prompt (Enter launches, Shift+Enter inserts a newline, matching Claude Code's composer); the server opens a **new iTerm2 window**, `cd`s there, runs `claude "<prompt>"` (e.g. `claude "/review-pr 1234"`), and the new card appears on the dashboard within seconds (the session registers itself).
10. **Triage by status** — summary tiles filter the grid to just waiting / reply / done / busy sessions.
11. **End a session** — ✕ on the card interrupts, sends `/exit`, and closes the pane once the process exits. A `done` card closes without asking; a working/blocked/awaiting card asks for confirmation first, since ending terminates the session's context and in-progress work.
12. **Rename a session** — ✎ next to the title; empty input reverts to the auto title.
13. **Watch live usage** — a strip under the summary tiles totals context-in-use and recent output tokens across active sessions (recomputed from transcripts every tick, no persisted/stale stats); each card shows its own `ctx · ↑output`.
14. **Observe-only degradation** — sessions in unscriptable terminals keep full observation; their composer/buttons are disabled with an explanatory placeholder.
15. **Switch theme** — the header button cycles 🌗 auto (follows the system appearance, live) → ☀️ light → 🌙 dark; auto is the default, an explicit choice persists across visits.
16. **Expand a card** — ⛶ in the card header blows it up to a large centered, resizable overlay for a roomier feed/mirror; ⛶ again, Esc, or a backdrop click returns it to its grid spot.
17. **Queue work as a candidate** — switch to the **Candidates** tab to see launchable pending work (added by a running session, the launch page's "Add to candidates", or the New candidate form). Filter the list, reprioritize (▲/▼), edit the skill/prompt, then **Launch** (becomes a live session) or **Dismiss**. The tab's count badge surfaces new candidates while you're on the Sessions tab.

### API contract

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/sessions` | GET | snapshot of all live sessions |
| `/api/events` | GET (SSE) | pushes the snapshot whenever it changes (1.5s poll) |
| `/api/sessions/:pid/send` | POST `{text, pressEnter}` | type into the session's pane |
| `/api/sessions/:pid/key` | POST `{key}` | inject a key: `1`, `2`, `escape`, `enter`, `up`, `down`, `tab` |
| `/api/sessions/:pid/focus` | POST | raise the pane in iTerm2 |
| `/api/sessions/:pid/screen` | GET | bottom of the pane's visible text (terminal mirror) |
| `/api/sessions/:pid/text?at=` | GET | full text of the assistant message at that transcript timestamp (feed entries are truncated to 200 chars to keep SSE light) |
| `/api/sessions/:pid/title` | POST `{title}` | set a custom title; empty clears the override |
| `/api/sessions/:pid/end` | POST | Esc → `/exit` → close pane; 409 if the session won't exit |
| `/api/projects` | GET | recent project dirs for the New Session picker |
| `/api/skills?cwd=` | GET | skills/commands available for a session in that dir |
| `/api/sessions/new` | POST `{cwd, prompt?, skill?}` | open a new iTerm2 tab and launch `claude` there; `skill` is composed into a leading `/skill` (with `prompt` as its arguments) server-side, so callers needn't know the slash-command convention. Returns `{ok, cwd, prompt}` — the new pid isn't known synchronously (the card appears on the next scan). |
| `/api/candidates` | GET | the candidate list (also carried in the SSE snapshot) |
| `/api/candidates` | POST `{cwd, skill?, prompt?, priority?, reason?, source?, producer?, ref?, dedupeKey?}` | add a fully-specified candidate; reuses `/sessions/new`'s validation; deduped on `dedupeKey`; rejected (429) past `maxPending`. Returns `{id}`. |
| `/api/candidates/:id` | PATCH `{prompt?, skill?, priority?}` | edit / reprioritize a candidate |
| `/api/candidates/:id/launch` | POST | spawn it (same path as `/sessions/new`), mark `launched`; 409 at the `maxConcurrent` cap |
| `/api/candidates/:id/dismiss` · `/undismiss` | POST | mark `dismissed` / restore to `pending` |
| `/api/candidates/:id` | DELETE | remove the item from the list now (the ✕ Clear action) |

The SSE snapshot is `{sessions, candidates, caps:{maxConcurrent, maxPending}, now}` — the
candidate list rides the same 1.5 s diff-and-push loop, so any add/edit/launch/dismiss/clear
reaches every open dashboard immediately. A once-a-minute retention sweep piggy-backs the
snapshot tick, pruning aged-out history: `launched` items after a short window (hours — set
by `launchedRetentionHours`, they're already live sessions) and `dismissed` items after
`retentionDays`.

### Send-message sequence

```
UI Send ─► POST /send ─► ps -E <pid> → ITERM_SESSION_ID (cached)
                       ─► osascript: find iTerm2 session by id → write text (no newline)
                       ─► wait 300 ms, then send Enter as a separate keystroke
```

The two-step write matters: Claude Code's TUI treats a burst of input as a paste, so a
newline sent together with the text is absorbed into the pasted content instead of
submitting it. Typing first and sending Enter after a short pause submits reliably.

### Launching from other tools (launch links)

`POST /api/sessions/new` is the canonical launch API; the New Session form and any
external caller (a script, an MCP tool, or another Claude session) hit the same endpoint
with `{cwd, prompt?, skill?}`. For the common case of one session handing off work to a
new one, the dashboard serves a confirmation page at **`/launch.html?cwd=…&prompt=…&skill=…`**:
a Claude session can emit that URL in its output, and clicking it opens a page that shows
the target directory, skill, and prompt with a **Launch** button. The button is what calls
the POST API — the bare link never spawns on its own. This keeps the action off a plain
GET (no drive-by spawns from link prefetch or an accidental click) while still being a
single clickable link, and it lets the user see exactly what will run before it does. The
page offers two buttons: **Launch now** (spawns immediately) and **Add to candidates**
(stages it on the Candidates tab for later review), so the emitting session lets you pick
immediate vs. queued-for-review.

## 6. Design decisions & trade-offs

- **Read Claude's own state files instead of heuristics** — status is exact, including *why* a session is waiting. Trade-off: file format is undocumented/internal, could change between Claude Code versions (it's versioned in the file, easy to adapt).
- **Zero npm dependencies** — `node server/src/index.js` just works; nothing to install, audit, or update.
- **SSE over WebSockets** — one-directional live updates are all we need; SSE is simpler and auto-reconnects natively.
- **Bounded transcript reads** (head 256 KB / tail 512 KB) — transcripts grow to many MB; the dashboard stays O(1) per refresh regardless of session age.
- **Pluggable terminal backends, detected per session** — each session is routed by what actually hosts it (its env), so mixed setups (some sessions in iTerm2, some in tmux) work simultaneously. Unsupported terminals degrade to observe-only cards rather than failing clicks.
- **tmux as the portability path** — the tmux backend uses only the tmux CLI, so it carries interaction to Linux/WSL and any host terminal.
- **Live usage from transcripts, not persisted stats** — `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` lags by up to a day; the dashboard computes context-in-use and recent output from the live transcript tails instead. Recent-output is the tail window's sum, not a lifetime total (kept bounded by design), and is summed per API message id — the transcript repeats the same `usage` on every content-block line of one response, so a per-line sum would inflate 3-5×. Plan limits aren't persisted locally by Claude Code, so they are deliberately not shown.
- **AI-derived titles via headless `claude -p`, not the API** — the terminal title Claude Code writes summarizes only the *latest exchange*, so a side question ("is it stuck?") renames a PR-review session. `aiTitles.js` instead feeds the starting prompt plus the recent activity feed to Claude and asks for the session's *primary task*, weighing sustained activity over the last message. It shells out to `claude -p --model haiku` (draws on the user's existing subscription; no Console account or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required) rather than calling the API. Cost controls: regenerate only when a session gains a new user turn (tracked by a per-session turn key, cached with the title in `~/.claude-dashboard/ai-titles.json`), one generation at a time, 2-minute back-off after failures, 90s timeout. Headless runs execute in `~/.claude-dashboard/headless` with a `CLAUDE_DASH_INTERNAL=1` env marker; the session registry skips any registry entry with that cwd, so the dashboard's own workers never show up as cards. Opt out with `CLAUDE_DASH_AI_TITLES=0`; on any failure the title chain silently falls back to the terminal title.
- **Dark and light themes via CSS variables only** — every color in `style.css` lives in a variable on `:root` (dark, the default) with a complete counterpart under `[data-theme="light"]`; no rule hardcodes a color. The header toggle cycles three modes — 🌗 auto (follows `prefers-color-scheme` live, so scheduled OS day/night switching works), ☀️ light, 🌙 dark — flipping `data-theme` on `<html>`. Auto is the default (nothing stored); an explicit choice persists in `localStorage`, and an inline `<head>` script applies the resolved theme before the stylesheet loads (no flash). The reply popup follows the "Markdown Reader" extension's matching theme pair (one-dark / one-light). Deliberate exception: the terminal mirror stays dark in both themes — it mirrors a real terminal pane.
- **Subagent (sidechain) events filtered out** of the feed — keeps the action feed readable; the main-chain Agent tool call still shows.
- **Candidates are inert data, launched explicitly** — a candidate is a stored plan, not a running thing; the producer API (`POST /api/candidates`) can't make anything spawn on its own, so a session or external tool proposing work never bypasses your review. Launch reuses the exact `/sessions/new` validation + spawn path (no second way to start a session), and is gated by `maxConcurrent` so a backlog can't flood the machine; `maxPending` bounds the list (adds past it are rejected and logged, never silently dropped). The list is a single JSON file written atomically by the one event loop — same single-writer pattern as titles/AI-titles, no locking. **In-page tabs, not a second page**: the Candidates view shares the one SSE stream, theme, and toast plumbing — it's a view toggle, so launching a candidate and watching it become a live card stays within one app.
- **`reply` vs `done` is a heuristic** — question detection plus the undelivered-deliverable check. Side-effect matching is deliberately invocation-shaped (`git push`, `gh pr comment`) rather than word-shaped: "show PR commits" must not count as a delivery. It can still misclassify; the cost of an error is just a wrong tile/animation, and the banner shows the actual closing text so the user can judge.

## 7. Possible future extensions

- **Candidate producers — watchers & the agentic classifier.** Candidates are built to take
  producers beyond the manual/launch-page/running-session paths shipped today. The next one
  is a **Slack watcher**: an in-process poll loop that turns an allowlisted reaction/mention
  into a candidate. It (and a `POST /api/candidates/from-text` endpoint for a session that
  only has free text) would share a **`classify.js`** — a headless `claude -p` reader
  (reusing the `aiTitles.js` machinery) that reads the message plus the cwd's skill list and
  returns a skill-tagged plan `{skill, prompt, reason, confidence}`, editable before launch.
  The candidate store, API, and UI here are the foundation that work builds on.
- Session history view (ended sessions, durations, outcomes)
- Desktop notifications (Notification API) when a session flips to `waiting`
- Backends for kitty / WezTerm (both have remote-control CLIs)
- Lifetime token totals per session (incremental transcript offsets instead of tail windows)
